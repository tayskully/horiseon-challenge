# Module 1 Challenge:
# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This challenge was to clean up the html code of html and css code of a working webpage, to make the page optimized for search engines, and to bring the page up to accessibility standards with alt attributes.

## Installation

In order to get the full experience, users must open "inspect" to view the html elements and structure, after admiring how well it still functions. 

## Usage

You may scroll up and down on this page, click the links to jump to the content you crave, but whatever you do, do not reduce the size below 930px!!!!!!!!!
